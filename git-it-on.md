> [A] free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything **from small to very large projects** with speed and efficiency. ([git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/))

**You are already using products built with the help of Git**

> - originally built for Linux kernel development
  - thousands of people, millions of lines of code
> - used now by all major software products and companies (Android, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, etc.); both internally & publicly

> [A] free and open source distributed version control system designed to **handle everything** from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ([git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/))

**Works with all filetypes**

> - like good backup system
> - very useful for line- or paragraph-based text (software source code)
> - medium useful for figures
> - not useful for big non-text, or auto-generated files

**control over document versions:**

> - recording & commenting changes
> - displaying change history
> - reverting old changes (line-by-line possible)

**asynchronous team-work**

> - entire database of project history is stored in project folder
>   - sync folder with Git server upload changes (like Adobe's comment syncing system in Journal of Phycology

## What is it good against? Too many files!

## What is it good against? Unnamed versions!

## What is it good for? Documentation!

## Basic vocabulary

- **repository** = Git's database of file versions in a watched folder

![](images/repo-folder.png)

## Basic vocabulary

- **commit** = set of logically connected changes within same (or across different) file(s) that are checked into the repository

![](images/logical-commit-across-files.png)

## Advanced vocabulary

> - **branches** = different contexts in same repository (cheaply created for a side experiment & then either merged or deleted)

![](images/branching-illustration.png)

> - **switching branches** = letting Git serve only the files in that branch to you
> - **merging** = integration of changes from one branch into another

## How to start using it? 

> 1. Download a Git client (for example from windows.github.com, or check [git-scm.com/downloads/guis](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/win)) & install
> 1. create new folder initialise it as a repository
> 1. start adding files & editing them
> 1. commit logically connected edits and changes 
> 1. *Optional (collaboration, backup, publishing, etc): create account with a Git-hosting service like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in), [GitHub](https://github.com/join), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/)*

## What to use Git for?

> - small, new projects (report, diagram in R

## What is it good for?

### Culturally

> - documenting your work (for colleagues, students, reviewers, your future self, etc.) 
> - collaborative work on same project / set of files

### Technically

> - line-based text files: scripts (problems only if same lines are edited)
> - version control (highlighting & cryptographic proof of changes)
> - (automatic) publishing (pre-prints, raw data, etc.)
> - gratis backup & cheap syncing on top
