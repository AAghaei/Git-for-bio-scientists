**File type agnostic, but line- or paragraph-based text works best**

**control over document versions:**

> - recording & commenting changes
> - displaying change history
> - reverting old changes (line-by-line possible)

## What is it good against? File creep!

## What is it good for?

### Culturally

> - documenting your work (for colleagues, students, reviewers, your future self, etc.)
> - collaborative work on same project

#### Technically

> - line-based text files: scripts (problems only if same lines are edited)
> - version control (highlighting & cryptographic proof of changes)
> - (automatic) publishing (pre-prints, raw data, etc.)
> - gratis backup & cheap syncing on top


## Basic vocabulary [ ] Order differently?

- **repository** = Git's database of file versions in a watched folder

![](images/repo-folder.png)

## Basic vocabulary

- **staging area** = selection of saved file changes disk already, but not yet committed to repository

![](images/uncommitted-changes.png)

## Basic vocabulary [ ] Order differently?

- **commit** = set of logically connected changes within same (or across different) file(s) that are checked into the repository

![](images/logical-commit-across-files.png)

## Advanced vocabulary

> - **branches** = different contexts in same repository (cheaply created for a side experiment & then either merged or deleted)

![](images/branching-illustration.png)

> - **switching branches** = letting Git serve only the files in that branch to you
> - **merging** = integration of changes from one branch into another

## How to start using it? 

> 1. Download a Git client (for example from windows.github.com, or check [git-scm.com/downloads/guis](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/win)) & install
> 1. create new folder initialise it as a repository
> 1. start adding files & editing them
> 1. commit logically connected edits and changes 
> 1. *Optional (collaboration, backup, publishing, etc): create account with a Git-hosting service like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in), [GitHub](https://github.com/join), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/)*

## What to use Git for?

> - small, new projects (report, diagram in R
